    /// This class wraps the <b>Octokit</b> and <b>LibGit2Sharp</b> packages, adding methods for common scenerios.
    /// The problem is that also these packages are nice, it's not always obvious how to perform many
    /// operations.  This package addresses some of these issues via the `GitGubRepo` class.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// For example, <b>LibGit2Sharp</b> doesn't provide methods for operations like: <b>Fetch</b>, <b>Push</b>,
    /// <b>Remove Branch</b>, or <b>Undo</b>.  <b>Octokit</b> doesn't have methods for <b>Remove Branch</b>
    /// and also seems to be missing direct support for other common operations and some of the 
    /// methods it does have, complete asynchronously which makes it harder to script a series of
    /// GitHub related operations.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Another annoyance with **Octokit** and **LibGit2Sharp** is that the define a lot of types with
    /// the same names, like **Repository**.  This makes it more difficult to write code that uses
    /// these libraries by forcing developers to use fully qualified type names or redefine type
    /// names via **using statements**.  **GitHubRepo** helps avoid these conflicts for many scenarios.
